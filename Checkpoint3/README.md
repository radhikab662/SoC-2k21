Checkpoint 3 (18th July, 2021)

Task 6 (ID: C1)-
Through this task we were introduced to app development and we learnt about how TensorFlowLite and the Android Studio works.
We made an android app that uses the phone camera to estimate the age and gender of people's faces.
We learnt how to convert a Keras neural network into TensorFlowLite format and run it on android devices.

Task 7(ID: C2)-
We learnt how to perform facial recognition using OpenCV, python and deep learning on google colab. 
Here we used the dlib library and face_recognition module that outputs a list of 128 real-valued numbers that are used to quantify a face. 
Our dataset is made of characters from the movie 'Jurassic World', 'Jurassic Park'. This program will be able to recognise these characters in both image and video format.
It also creates a cluster/montage of similar faces.
