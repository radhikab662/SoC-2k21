Second phase:
In this phase, we went on to learn about the basic terms involved in machine learning, basics of computer vision and image processing. 
Deep learning and neural networks were also introduced.

Checkpoint 2(8th June, 2021)
We did 2 tasks as a part of checkpoint,

Task 4 (ID: B3)-
Here we made a live age and gender detector which uses the cv2 library and pre-trained Caffe models. 

Task 5 (ID: B4)-
The program written for this task detects the age and gender of the people appearing in a youtube video. 
The output video with the box-frame and predicted age, gender gets downloaded.
